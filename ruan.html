			<h2>Ruan -- Integrated Campaign</h2>
			<p>Transportation is changing, and Ruan is a big part of that. Shippers need Ã  la carte services that give them only the custom transportation solutions they need. They need options, and that's just what you get when you work with Ruan.
</p>
			<p>You can choose Dedicated Contract Carriage and Warehouse Management. Mode Selection and Supply Chain Optimization. Bulk Transportation and Carrier Management.</p>
			<p>In essence, Ruan is selling choice. They are selling AND. So we made that the center of their campaign and rolled it out in all their channels. It's been very successful for the company and won the agency multiple Gold ADDYs, including a Judges' Choice.</p>
			<h3>Integrated Solutions B2B Ad</h3>
